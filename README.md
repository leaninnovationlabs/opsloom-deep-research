# README
Opsloom empowers you to build and deploy custom AI agents and assistants tailored for your enterprise. Automate tasks and seamlessly integrate intelligent solutions into your existing applications with our responsive, out-of-the-box framework. Develop domain-specific assistants to streamline workflows and enhance productivity across your organization.

# Local Dev Environment Setup
Using env.example as a reference, create a .env file and include all keys and environment variables.
You will use this file as an argument to the Docker command which runs the application.

### Docker setup
To run this locally with minimal overhead, run using the command
```bash
    docker compose up
```

## 1. Setup Python Environment

We are using uv for package management.

`https://docs.astral.sh/uv/#getting-started`

install for Mac/Linux with this command: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/#getting-started

uv automatically creates a virtual environment when running certain commands. To install the dependencies in pyproject.toml in the virtual environment, please run

```
    uv sync
```

## 2. Running Database Locally
Opsloom works out of the box utilizing postgres as the database. It utilizes database to store the user data and the conversation data. Opsloom also provides some examples on how to use Postgres as the vector database to store the embeddings.

2.1 Ensure that you have a Postgres container with pgvector running . 
    
You can use the script in db/start_postgres.sh will start one for you or you can use an external AWS RDS. You can configure the default username and password in the .sh file

```bash
    sh db/start_postgres.sh
```

2.2 Run initial set of database script using alembic

This will run all the scripts under the db folder. The Postgres connection string is read from .env

```bash
    uv run alembic upgrade head
```

## 3. Run backend server
Run python fast api server using the following command

```bash
    uv sync 
    uv run uvicorn server:app --reload --port 8080
```

Once you have the backend server running you can invoke the backend APIs by launching Bruno and loading the /docs/api_docs folder


## 3. Run frontend server

Run vite server using the following command

```bash
    cd frontend
    npm i
    npm run dev
```


## Run docs server (optional)

Run the docs server using the following command
```bash
    npm i
    npm run docs:dev
```

# Database Migrations Scripts

1. Steps to follow to create a new database script

    To create a new script you can either run the following or copy an existing file and rename it
    ```
        uv run alembic revision -m "create account table"
    ```

2. Downgrade a version

    To downgrade a version you can run the following command, this will downgrade the database by 1 version

    ```
        uv run alembic downgrade -1
    ```


-------------------

# Run Using Docker

Run the command:

```bash
    sudo docker build -t opsloom .
```

NOTE: If you run into problems on mac see: [Mac Troubleshooting](#mac-docker-installation)

```bash
    docker run -d --env-file .env --name opsloom -p 8080:8080 opsloom
```

Pull up `http://localhost:8080/opsloom` and confirm the backend is running


# Troubleshooting 

## Mac Docker Installation:

If get the error `failed to solve: error getting credentials - err: exit status 1, out: â€œ`: 

Open up $HOME/.docker/config.json :

```json
{
	"auths": {
		"https://index.docker.io/v1/": {}
	},
	"credsStore": "desktop",
	"currentContext": "desktop-linux"
}
```


Change from `desktop` to `osxkeychain`:

```json
{
	"auths": {
		"https://index.docker.io/v1/": {}
	},
	"credsStore": "osxkeychain",
	"currentContext": "desktop-linux"
}
```

1. If you get error with psycopg2, you can install the binary version using the following command

    ```
      pip install "psycopg[binary]"
    ```

2. Get the Icons from using the following link

    [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/icons?selected=Material+Symbols+Outlined:support_agent:FILL@0;wght@400;GRAD@0;opsz@24&icon.query=car&icon.size=24&icon.color=%235f6368)


### Command to run Langgraph Studio
```
    PYTHONPATH=. uv run langgraph dev
```

### Note for Deep-Research agent
To run this agent, ensure that you have set OPENAI_KEY and TAVILY_API_KEY in .env
